## Predicting Ranked Choice Voting
### Introduction

Ranked choice voting is a voting system where people can vote for and rank candidates in order of their preference. A consulting company would like to know the best way to increase people's support for ranked choice voting in the U.S. Survey data needs to be analyzed to find the types of people who do and do not already support ranked choice voting. With this information, the company can decide who they should show their education and advertisement campaigns to. 

The main goals of the company are to find who currently supports ranked choice voting and find how to predict people who might not support ranked choice voting. By predicting who might not support ranked choice voting, the company can direct their education and advertisement campaigns to those people. As a result, the company can increase support for ranked choice voting in the United States through their targetted campaigns.
